# Bayesian Neural Network
Implement Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using Pytorch to predict mean and both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties for the quantity of interest (QoI). In Bayesian setting, there are two main types of uncertainty; *aleatoric* uncertainty, which captures the noise inherent in the observations and *epistemic* uncertainty that accounts for the uncertainty in the model. By collecting more data we can reduce the epistemic uncertainty. However, aleatoric uncertainty cannot be reduced even if more data were to be collected.
